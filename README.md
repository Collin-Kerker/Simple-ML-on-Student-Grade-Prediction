## Grade Classifier

**Description:** Use various different metrics about students like their parents colllege level or weather they get free lunch or not to try and predict their final grades

**Motivation:** I would like to do this not only because it is interesting but also I think things like this can help students, espceially those who might need more support than others in order to produce better learning results, such as students with free/reduced lunch most of the time prefrom worse than the others and that means that their living condition and wealth do have an effect on their grades, meaning that giving those students more support would most likely help them to perform better in school

**Setup/Installation**
- install all of the dependencies in the requirments file
- run python -m src.train in order to run the training file
- view the rerults in the results folder
# Note: all of this was done on VSCode and was run with the python environment of 3.17

**Reproduce Results:** to reproduce the results just follow the setup/install process as that should be all that is nececary seeeing as how the seed is pre set to 42

**Key Findings:** Some of the ai findings that I found are that studying prep always helps, lunch type actually matters as it shows possible bad conditions at the home of the student affecting study conditions, and the parents education level did also matter in the end, all this shows that the economic status and preperation for the tests are all factors that will lead to higher or lower test grades for the students
